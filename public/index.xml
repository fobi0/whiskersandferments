I imagined ending up with a sticky ball of strings that you can chew on but it is surprisingly easy. The important part is to let it rest for a few hours. Good thing here: it lasts at least 3-4 days in the fridge so you can make them way ahead and the actual time to serve with a ready dough is 15-20min.</description></item><item><title>Vegan Bolognese</title><link>www.whiskersandferments.com/posts/vegetarian-bolognese/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 10:38:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>www.whiskersandferments.com/posts/vegetarian-bolognese/</guid><description>We are starting up with one of my all time favourites: Vegan Bolognese. It is not comparable to an actual one but it resembles a lot of the textures and flavours pretty well and it is a good, quick and easy option to make Spaghetti or Lasagna. It is also way quicker than actual Bolognese, since there is no Meat to add to the flavor profile. Soy sauce and Red wine together with the mushrooms still adding a lot of depth to the dish and helping to give you the umami flavor that you need for a good bolognese.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>www.whiskersandferments.com/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 23:30:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>www.whiskersandferments.com/contact/</guid><description>Contact me via email at: fabianbusse635(at)gmail.com</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>www.whiskersandferments.com/posts/init-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 23:30:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>www.whiskersandferments.com/posts/init-post/</guid><description>Hello! You catched me in my natural habitat!
Welcome to this small blog.
if you are new here then I probably sent you the link I guess. Anyways.. welcome here and great that you visit :)
This website is meant to be mostly for me to have an easy and quick option to save and share my ideas, recipes and experiments with the world. So don&amp;rsquo;t be confused. It can get weirdly and confusing here, since I don&amp;rsquo;t really have an idea of what I am doing here either.</description></item><item><title>It's me</title><link>www.whiskersandferments.com/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 23:30:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>www.whiskersandferments.com/about/</guid><description>Hey there, fellow food explorers and digital wanderers! It&amp;rsquo;s me! By day, I&amp;rsquo;m the tech guy, and by night, I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best to work with the magic of culinary experiences in my kitchen!
You might be wondering, how does someone go from debugging code to fermenting cabbages? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s simple: I believe in the power of synergy! Just like how a good tech stack needs the right components, my recipes rely on the perfect blend of locally sourced ingredients.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>www.whiskersandferments.com/privacy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 23:30:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>www.whiskersandferments.com/privacy/</guid><description>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.
