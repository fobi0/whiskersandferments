I imagined ending up with a sticky ball of strings that you can chew on but it is surprisingly easy. The important part is to let it rest for a few hours. Good thing here: it lasts at least 3-4 days in the fridge so you can make them way ahead and the actual time to serve with a ready dough is 15-20min.</description></item></channel></rss>
