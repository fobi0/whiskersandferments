This "sashimi" is made out of beetroot. It has an incredible long shelf live, a texture that is really meaty and chewy and it tastes amazing. I use in multiple setups:
- Of course as an addition or replacement of fish in Sashimi or Sushi. It has a similar texture to raw tuna and therefore is a perfect match for the next vegan sushi party.
- As a Carpaccio or Tartar it works perfectly as a replacement of the beef.
- As a cured ham it is a perfect companion for your next sandwich. You can also cold smoke it a little to get a complex smoke flavor on it.

In any form it is a delicious and useful ingredient for a variety of dishes. Due to its high salt content, it will last for a long time in the fridge.

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Beetroot| 100%| 500g | Brush some oil on it and bake it in the oven for around 45min at 180°C. The inside need to be soft and a fork should go in without big resistance.|
| *For the brine:* ||||
| Soy Sauce | 20% | 100g||
| Water | 40% | 200g ||
| Salt | 2% | 10g ||
| Kombu | 10% | 50g ||
| Rice Vinegar | 20% | 100g||
| Sugar | 2% | 10g ||
||||Mix all the ingredients till the sugar and salt is dissolved.|
|||| Cut the Beets in pieces. The bigger the pieces the longer it takes them to dry later. Please notice that they will loose about 30% of their volume and weight.|
|||| Add the pieces to a jar and pour the brine over it. Make sure every beetroot is covered with the brine. Leave it in the fridge for 3-5days.|
|||| After the curing process, pour away the liquid ( you can use it as a dipping sauce or as a flavor bomb for noodles or stir fry if you don't want to waste it). Then place the beets on a rack and dry them at 55°C for around 3-7hours depending on the size and water content of the beets. The beets should be chewy and dense and still contain some water.|
|||| brush the dried beetroots with a neutral oil. This gives it more fattiness and preserves it even better|
|||| For plating slice them up as thin as possible and enjoy the texture and the saltiness of it.|
