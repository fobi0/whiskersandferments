It's corn! And also it's corn season! So let's do some Barbeque ribs out of it and enjoy them while the summer slowly runs out. I love this recipe because it does what I want from a vegan adaption of a dish: It gives the same feeling, the same "fun" and the same mess while eating them as the original does. Still it's a unique and special dish which does not try to be meat but just stands for itself. 

You can also smoke them over the fire or fry them but this version is just the easiest. This recipe is for 2 People with a lot of barbeque sauce left for dipping.
