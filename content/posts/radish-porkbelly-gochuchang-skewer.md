I am a big fan of skewers. Easy to make, fun to eat and almost every food culture on the world has some kind of it. This combination is one of my favourites. The fat of the porkbelly combined with the crunchy radish and the Gochuchang is just too tasty for not trying it.

You can either grill them on direkt heat over the fire or put them in the oven on grill mode. It is important to have a high heat to get a little bit of charring on them.

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| *For the Marinade*|||
| Gochuchang | %      | 15g       | |
| Soy Sauce  | %|     | 15g       | |
|||| Mix them together to form a thick paste |
| *For the skewers* ||||
| Pork belly | 100% | 150g | Remove the skin and cut the porkbelly in small pieces. |
| Radish | 100% | 150g | Cut them in half|
|||| Add the porkbelly and the radish to a bowl and add the marinade to it. Let it sit for at least 2hours. |
|||| Put them on the skewers and roast them on a grill for around 10min while turning it every minute or so. Make sure they have a nice char and serve them.|
