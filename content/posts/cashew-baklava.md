Baklava well made is an awesome, crunchy and satisfying experience. This recipe is pretty close to original Baklava. I just needed something more fresh for the last course of this meal and decided to go with cashews, Dandelion Honey and some lemonjuice to brighten up the flavor. Of course we are also making the dandelion Honey ourself.

This recipe is for a small tray of baklava (20*15cm).

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| *For the Dandelion Honey*|||
| Dandelion heads | 100%      | 100g       | place in water overnight to remove dirt and bugs. remove the green parts.|
|Water | 350% | 350g| Mix it with the Dandelions and bring it to a simmer for 10-15min. Then leave it for the night to infuse|
Sugar | 300% | 300g| Add the sugar to the mixture and simmer it for another 15-30min or till you reached the right texture.  |
||||Take about 150g of it and water it down to a runny sirup. and set aside|
|*For the filling:*||| |
|Cashews | 200%| 200g | Chop them till you get small chunks around 2-3mm. It is fine to have a little bit of an uneven texture. That helps the dish a lot.|
| Lemon zest | 10% | 10g | Mix it with the cashews and set aside|
| *For the Baklava:* ||||
| Yufka sheets | | 20 Layers á 20x15cm ||
| Vegetable oil |60%| 60g||
|||| Get a fitting oven save pan and place down half of the yufka sheets. Before each layer brush the sheet with some neutral vegetable oil.|
|||| After half of the sheets are placed, fill the pan evenly with the cashew-lemon mix. Then add the other layers on topp brushing every layer with oil. Bake it in the oven at 180°C for 20-30min till golden brown and delicious.|
|||| Just before it is ready to go out of the oven, heat up the watered down dandelion honey and heat it up. As soon as the Baklava gets out of the oven pour the sirup over it to caramelize it in the hot pan. It's on you how sweet and sticky you want it to have.|
