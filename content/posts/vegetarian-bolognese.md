We are starting up with one of my all time favourites: Vegan Bolognese. It is not comparable to an actual one but it resembles a lot of the textures and flavours pretty well and it is a good, quick and easy option to make Spaghetti or Lasagna. It is also way quicker than actual Bolognese, since there is no Meat to add to the flavor profile. Soy sauce and Red wine together with the mushrooms still adding a lot of depth to the dish and helping to give you the umami flavor that you need for a good bolognese. I am using the same base for chili sin carne as well with adding cacao, beans, chilis and some more spices.

For two people I recommend around 150-200g of mushrooms to start. The recipe is based of the mushrooms so if you need food for more people, just multiply the amount of mushrooms and then just multiply its weight with the percent. So for example you have 4 People thats 400g of mushrooms so you would need 400g*0.3 = 120g of Tofu for it.

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| *For the "Meat":*|||
| Button Mushrooms | 100%      | 200g       | Grate them rough|

| Vegetable oil    | 20%       | 40g        ||
