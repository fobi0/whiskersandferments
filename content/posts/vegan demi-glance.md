Based on the recipe of the wonderful book "The Art of foodparing", I developed a simpler, yet delicious recipe for a vegan demi-glance. You can use it on roast, grilled vegetables or paired with tomato. It can be prepared in advanced, held in a squeeze bottle and be reheated right before dinner as well.

This one is a lighter sauce, you can thicken it by adding a little bit more tomato puree or adding a small amount of flour to bind it.

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Freshly brewed coffee| 100%| 200g | |
|Star anis | 2%| 1 whole||
|Pepper Corns| 5%| 10g ||
| Soy Sauce | 10% | 20g ||
| Tomato puree | 10% | 20g ||
| Onion chopped | 20% | 40g ||
|||| Mix all ingredients together, and reduce the liquid in a small pot for around 5-10min. You can reduce it further to create a deeper flavour as well. Add salt to taste then pass it to a sieve. |
