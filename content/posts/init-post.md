Hello! You catched me in my natural habitat!

Welcome to this small blog.

if you are new here then I probably sent you the link I guess. Anyways.. welcome here and great that you visit :)

This website is meant to be mostly for me to have an easy and quick option to save and share my ideas, recipes and experiments with the world. So don't be confused. It can get weirdly and confusing here, since I don't really have an idea of what I am doing here either.

In the following days I try to add some more recipes and find a good solution of how to do measurements in here, since I literally have no units for most of my recipes but it will turn out fine for sure! :)
