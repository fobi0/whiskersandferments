This recipe was always something I wanted to try out but it looks so complex to hand-pull noodles. I imagined ending up with a sticky ball of strings that you can chew on but it is surprisingly easy. The important part is to let it rest for a few hours. Good thing here: it lasts at least 3-4 days in the fridge so you can make them way ahead and the actual time to serve with a ready dough is 15-20min. The oil garlic and chili makes it a perfect comfy food for the evening. You can fry some meats, tofu or egg and just add it to the dish.

The measurements are based on the amount of dough you are making. For 2 servings I recommend going for 150g-200g with a 50% hydration by weight.

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| *For the dough:* |||
| Flour   | 100%      | 200g       ||
| Water   | 50%       | 100g       ||
| Salt    | 1%        | 2g         ||
|||| Mix all the ingredients till smooth. Let them sit covered for 45min. Then knead it again and bring it to a rectangle form around 2cm thick. Cut it in 3-4cm pieces and brush some oil on it so that they don't stick. Then leave it in the fridge for at least 2hours  |
|*For the toppings:*||||
| Garlic      | 3%        | 6g         | Finely chopped|
| Chiliflakes | 2%        | 4g         ||
| Ginger      | 1%        | 2g         | Finely Chopped|
| Cumin       | 1%        | 2g         ||
| Szechuan Peppercorns    | 1%        | 2g ||
| Vegetable Oil| 30%       | 60g| Heat up |
||||When ready set up some salted boiling water. As soon as it boils you can start. Make an imprint of a chopstick horizontally over the middle of the longer side of each dough package. This imprint will help to divide the noddles in the middle later. Take one of the dough packages and hold them with your Index finger and your thumb on each side. Slowly pull them and slap the middle on the table to make pull it into a long noodle string. Divide the string in the middle to make a giant noodle loop out of it. Immediately boil it for 2-3min and place in a bowl. repeat for all packages. |
|||| Top the noodles with your toppings and make sure that you pile them up on the middle of it. Pour over the hot oil. It will be infused by the toppings and get a delicious flavor.|
