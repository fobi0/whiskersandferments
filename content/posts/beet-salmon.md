We already had the beetroot sashimi in an earlier post. This time we are using yellow beet marinate them a little differently. This is not a replacement for a classic smoked salmon, but it gives the perfect replacement and stands for its own, without imitating the flavour of fish, but giving a smokey, filling and absolutely delicious option for salads, sandwiches, bagels or the next vegan brunch

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Yellow beet| 100%| 500g | Brush some oil on it and bake it in the oven for around 45min at 180Â°C. The inside need to be soft and a fork should go in without big resistance.|
| *For the brine:* ||||
| Soy Sauce | 20% | 100g||
| Water | 40% | 200g ||
| Salt | 2% | 10g ||
| Pepper | 1% | 5g ||
| Rice Vinegar | 20% | 100g||
| Sugar | 2% | 10g ||
| Paprika Powder | 0.5% | 2.5g ||
| vegetable oil | 4% | 20g ||
||||Mix all the ingredients till the sugar and salt is dissolved. We are doing kind of an vinaigrette here|
|||| Cut the Beets in thin slices. We will not dry them this time, so you can make them as thin as you want them later in the process |
|||| Add the pieces to a jar and pour the brine over it. Make sure every beetroot is covered with the brine. Leave it in the fridge for at least 2 days. It will stay fresh for multiple days to a week afterwards.|
|||| After the curing process, take them out of the liquid and put them in a box for smoking. I use cold smoking with a smoking gun. It's easier and I can do it on the balcony of my appartment without creating a fire hazard. After that, put them back in the fridge and keep them covered so they don't dry out too much.|
|||| When you want to serve them, put them out of the fridge and brush each slice with some oil. serve them cool and enjoy this treat :) |
