We already had the beetroot sashimi in an earlier post. This time we are using yellow beet marinate them a little differently. This is not a replacement for a classic smoked salmon, but it gives the perfect replacement and stands for its own, without imitating the flavour of fish, but giving a smokey, filling and absolutely delicious option for salads, sandwiches, bagels or the next vegan brunch

| Ingredient         | Amount     | Example | Step |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Yellow beet| 100%| 500g | Brush some oil on it and bake it in the oven for around 45min at 180°C. The inside need to be soft and a fork should go in without big resistance.|
| *For the brine:* ||||
| Soy Sauce | 20% | 100g||
| Water | 40% | 200g ||
| Salt | 2% | 10g ||
| Pepper | 1% | 5g ||
| Rice Vinegar | 20% | 100g||
| Sugar | 2% | 10g ||
| Paprika Powder | 0.5% | 2.5g ||
| vegetable oil | 4% | 20g ||
||||Mix all the ingredients till the sugar and salt is dissolved. We are doing kind of an vinaigrette here|
|||| Cut the Beets in thin slices. We will not dry them this time, so you can make them as thin as you want them later in the process |
|||| Add the pieces to a jar and pour the brine over it. Make sure every beetroot is covered with the brine. Leave it in the fridge for 3-5days.|
|||| After the curing process, pour away the liquid ( you can use it as a dipping sauce or as a flavor bomb for noodles or stir fry if you don't want to waste it). Then place the beets on a rack and dry them at 55°C for around 3-7hours depending on the size and water content of the beets. The beets should be chewy and dense and still contain some water.|
|||| brush the dried beetroots with a neutral oil. This gives it more fattiness and preserves it even better|
|||| For plating slice them up as thin as possible and enjoy the texture and the saltiness of it.|
